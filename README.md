# Draw!

## About the project:
11
A website that allows you to share and paint together on canvas.
 Whether to express yourself in painting and have fun with friends or to be used as a whiteboard shared in a class between the teacher and the students.


Draw together and have fun with friends!
Several friends can draw together and complete each other's drawings.
Express your creativity in a fun way.

As a teacher you can use this website for a better explanation and teaching.
Just like a teacher who uses a whiteboard in class to add examples, write points, and create sketches, using this website will allow the students to join the teacher in the lesson activity and add/ write/ draw their own ideas and suggestions.
